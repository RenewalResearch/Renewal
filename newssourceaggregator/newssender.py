# About this file:
# This is the sending end of the queue
# the queue is named, and may not be duplicated
# the routing key is the queue we want to publish through IF EXCHANGE IS DEFAULT ''
# the body is the message
# the exchange parameter is in charge of sorting and pushing the messages to appropriate queues.
# note : we do NOT send messages directly through queues, but to the exchange actor which will redirect them
# There are a few exchange types available: direct, topic, headers and fanout.
# fanout broadcasts messages to all queues it knows

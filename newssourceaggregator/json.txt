JSON is a format based on two things : key and value (that's called a dictionary)
Dictionaries start with a bracket { and close with a bracket }
Key is always plain text between DOUBLE quotes, then a double colon introduces the Value.
Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.
Value can be a couple things :
Plain text
Numbers
Objects (another dictionary for example)
A list (or Array)
A boolean (true or false)
If value is a list, it is between brackets [] and each value is separated by a comma.
Full json example (properly indented but it doesn't need to be) :

{
	"TextKey" : "Plain text value",
	"NumberKey" : 42,
	"ArrayKey": ["List", "of", 4, "things"],
	"booleanKey":true,
	"ObjectKey": {
			"ObjectFirst Key":"objectValue"
		     }
}

If anything, it can be null (without quotes) but it cannot be nothing.

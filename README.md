# Renewal - A real-time evaluation platform for news recommender systems

News recommendation is a specific task in the area of recommender systems because of both the nature of items (news volatility, dynamic popularity, textual content, etc.) and the need to evaluate recommendation algorithms in real-time. Challenges are a fun way to stimulate research. We propose a platform called Renewal to host a news recommandation challenge. The platform provides the evaluation service for contenders programs submitted by research teams. To our knowledge, this platform is the only one which offers a user application fully dedicated to the cross-website and cross-language news articles recommendation task. It also offers a large panel of context / demographic clues and a long-term user history through a dedicated mobile app.
